# Features

Here is a comprehensive list of all the current functionality that AMII has to offer.

## Interactions

This is the proverbial meat and potatoes of the plugin.
You will have choicest of anime memes delivered right to your IDE as you program to your heart's content.

**MIKU**

As mention previously, our Meme Inference Knowledge Unit (or MIKU for short)
has the ability interact with you as you build code.
MIKU's preferred method of communication is Anime Memes.

If you are wondering what things you can do to cause MIKU give you memes, well just look below!

_All events are configurable to be enabled/disabled, see [configuration](#configuration) for more details_

### Startup Greeting

Just opening up a project in your IDE is cause for celebration.
Generally, MIKU is excited to see you again.
It gets dark when you are gone, so stick around a bit!

![Startup Greeting](./readmeAssets/project_load.gif)

> Note: All waiting notifications are set to the `timed` dismissal option.
> See the [dismissal](#dismissal) section for more details

### Test Results

Tests pass and tests fail, that's just a fact of life.
You know what's better than red x's and green check marks?

> Anime Memes

**Test Pass**
![Test Pass](./readmeAssets/test_pass.gif)

**Test Failures**
![Test Failure](./readmeAssets/test_fail.gif)

### Build Tasks

This is an IDE, right? Well, that means you can build code right from your editor.
It just so happens, that builds happen to fail from time to time.
You did put in that semicolon, right?

![Build Failures](./readmeAssets/build.gif)

Well MIKU knows when your builds fail too, so expect a response as well.

### Waiting

What do you mean you don't code all the time?
You mean that there are periods of time when you aren't using your IDE?

![Waiting](./readmeAssets/waiting.gif)

Well MIKU gets lonely, or a bit bored when you are gone.

> Note:
> - All waiting notifications are set to the `focus loss` dismissal option.
> See the [dismissal](#dismissal) section for more details.
> - Notifications by default are set to center,
> but can be configured in the [settings](#configuration).

### Exit Codes

So you got your code to build and deploy.
However, the program has a catastrophic error, which caused your poor application to terminate with a sad exit code.

![Exit Codes](./readmeAssets/exit_code.gif)

As you probably guessed by now, MIKU is always watching, and has the ability to reply to your mistakes.

**Allowed Exit Codes**

Programs that exit with:

  - **0**: Exited without issue
  - **130**: You terminated the proces (e.g. pressed the stop button)

are part of the default allowed exit codes, MIKU will not react to these (but can if you want to).

### Logs

Do you work on a project that takes a billion years for the application to start?
Good news! Your days of staring at your logs are over.

![Logs](./readmeAssets/log_watcher.gif)

You can ask MIKU nicely to watch the logs for you.
Expect a notification whenever your phrase appears in your logged output!

### On-Demand

`Tools | AMII Options | Show random Ani-Meme`

I suppose if you are bored, or just want to show off your Anime Memes, you have the ability to get memes on demand.

![On-demand](./readmeAssets/on_demand.gif)

## Personality

Don't get me wrong, having anime memes displayed in my IDE is awesome, but you know what's better?
Having custom tailored reactions, almost as if the memes displayed where hand-picked just for you!

As it just so happens, MIKU has various installed personality cores which enables such functionality.

### Frustration

MIKU is a fairly moody state machine and has many reactions to various events such as:
- Waiting for you to come back when you are away for some time
- Being really happy when your test pass.
- Becoming upset when your builds break and tests fail.

Thanks to advancements in technology, MIKU now also has the ability to feel your frustration when **things aren't working, WHY ARE THEY NOT WORKING!!**.
MIKU figures its good to inject a little humor into the mix and show you that they are frustrated as well.

**Frustration**
![Frustration](./readmeAssets/frustration.gif)

As a bonus, they also have the capability from evolving from being frustrated to full-blown rage.
This only happens when you have been triggering negative events in the frustration state for a given period.

**Rage**
![Rage](./readmeAssets/enraged.gif)

Not every person wants their companion to get frustrated.
So you have the ability to disable this part of their personality,
by preventing them from ever being frustrated in the first place! üòÑ

**Take a Chill Pill!**

`Tools | AMII Options | Relax MIKU`

Have you accidentally upset MIKU? I know I have (coding is hard).
Well thankfully there is a `Relax MIKU` action that works as described.
This will reset the personality core's state so that you can continue to mess up as you please.

In addition, MIKU's frustration will also cool-down over time without the need for your intervention.

### Smug

Have you ever been in a rut where anything that you do just winds up failing?
Remember that feeling of finally fixing the issue?

Well when you finally get all your ducks in a row, you and MIKU may feel a bit smug.

For instance, if your test fails to run, the next time your tests pass, you have a chance of getting a _smug_ reaction.

![Smugumin](./readmeAssets/smug.gif)

### Boredom

The longer that you are away from your IDE, the more MIKU get bored.

They will start of waiting patiently for you to return.
However, as time passes, you'll see that they can't entertain themselves forever.

Don't be surprised if you come back, and they are sleeping!

### Status

Ever want to know how MIKU is feeling at the moment?
They have the ability to display their current emotional state in your status bar.

![Status Bar Mood](./readmeAssets/mood_status_bar.png)

## Offline Mode

If you ever find yourself coding without any internet, don't worry friend, you can take MIKU with you.
All interactions that you have seen so far have been stored in a safe place on your computer, just for such an occasion!

# Configuration

`Tools | AMII Options | Show AMII's Settings`

Any way you want it, that's the way you need it!
AMII has a lot of customization that allows you to tailor the experience to your preferences.

## Sound

Haven't you heard? Well if you haven't, some of your interactions with MIKU may involve a related sound clip.

Not everybody wants to have their music interrupted as they are coding, so you can turn off all sound.
You even have the ability to turn the volume up and down as well!

## Content

**Preferred Gender**

We all have our own likes and dislikes (waifus, husbandos, giant robots, etc), well MIKU has the strokes for different folks.
This section will only show memes that contain **any** of the preferred gender.

**Preferred Character**

Only want to see content with your main squeeze?
Well you can nicely ask MIKU to only show images of your preferred character.
However, your favorite character may **not** be in an asset that MIKU can use to express their feelings.
Rather than getting nothing, you'll get another random image that matches your other preferences!

## Display

MIKU has to put your memes somewhere on your screen.
So here's how you can request to have your memes work the way you want them too.

**Position**

Each block represents a section where you want your meme to be anchored on your IDE's screen.

### Dismissal

Memes have to come and go, if they didn't exit then, it would be a bit hard to do any work.
Here's what each mode does.

**Timed**

So MIKU wants each meme to cycle at least once.
Some memes have a longer duration than others.
Here you can specify the minimum amount of time you want each meme to appear on the screen.

> **Tip**: If you want your `timed` meme to hang around for longer, just click on the meme!
> That will convert the dismissal mode to `focus loss`.
> Also handy for making long memes disappear sooner!

**Focus Loss**

Rather than letting MIKU decide on your meme duration, put yourself into control.
Memes created with the focus loss dismissal option will only disappear when you start coding or click outside the meme.

Because the meme's disappear when you are working, sometimes you can accidentally dismiss your meme.
So each meme is given a configurable duration where they are invulnerable to dismissal.
Which should buy you enough time to stop and enjoy it!

## Asset Sync

`Tools | AMII Options | Syncronize Assets`

Did you ask to have a new asset added?
Did you know that you can see all available assets here:
[https://amii-assets.unthrottled.io/](https://amii-assets.unthrottled.io/)?

Well you can start using that asset right away, using this action.
This updates your local lists of available assets to be the most current.

**Auto-Sync**: AMII is programmed to automatically update once every day,
to bring you the freshest and dankest anime memes on the reg.
