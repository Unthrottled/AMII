### Fixed

- Invulnerable memes that stay around forever [#108](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII/issues/108)
- Division by zero errors, thanks for reporting!

### Added

- A `Clear Memes` action just in case I didn't actually fix invulnerable memes.
  - Available via `Tools -> AMII Options -> Clear Memes`
- 2021.2 build support!

### Changed

- Assets that get downloaded in the background. Peferred assets will only be downloaded, that way I'm not paying for
  users to download assets that they won't see.
